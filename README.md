## Overview

Foundations of Reason is a structural framework for understanding and implementing artificial rational systems.

The work introduces a process-based model of intelligence grounded in:

- continuity of agency,
- recursive self-correction,
- error-aware adaptation,
- structural stability across time.

Rather than focusing on scaling parameters, this project explores the minimal architectural invariants required for sustained rational operation.

## Structure

The project consists of two main volumes:

### 1. Theoretical Volume
Defines the ontological and process foundations of reason:
- life as continuity,
- knowledge as structural mapping,
- diversity as adaptive capacity,
- irreversibility and error,
- self-modeling and dialogue.

### 2. Engineering Volume
Architectural specification for Artificial Reason systems:
- minimal cognitive core,
- closed-loop correction mechanisms,
- multi-layer memory architecture,
- stability modes (INIT → LEARNING → STABLE → DRIFT → SAFE_MODE → RECOVERY),
- incubator model for structured emergence.

## Core Thesis

Artificial Reason cannot be achieved through scaling alone.

It requires:
- closure of recursive self-correction loops,
- persistent structural identity across time,
- protection against irreversible model degradation,
- dynamic model revision under constraint.

## Current Focus

- Refinement of the incubator architecture
- Structural autonomy modeling
- Memory continuity design
- Error minimization mechanisms
- Long-term stability testing
